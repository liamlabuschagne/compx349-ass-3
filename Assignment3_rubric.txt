Basic requirement

 * All code compiles without warnings

Part 1 API: 

Pass
 * read greyscale sensors (via event handlers or otherwise)
 * operate LEDs
 * operate motors

Good
 * event driven 
    * custom events defined and used correctly
    * appropriate locations/uses
    * well executed, bonus

Excellent
 * code quality 
    * enums or defines used, not raw ints/chars for API functions
    * sensible, clear conditionals
    * minimal globals, combine into data structures
    * well executed, builds cleanly

Part 2

Pass - Line following:

 * using the API, not writing to pins
 * receive events from sensors (detect line)
 * algorithm 

Good - Intersections: 
 * using the API, not writing to pins
 * receive events from sensors (detect intersection)
 * algorithm 

Excellent
 * not hard coded list of directions
 * high code quality



Part 3 Advanced: all for excellent mark
 * quality of extension code 
 * graded on difficulty of extension to implement
